# 3D personal website using React Three Fiber

https://yazan.ca/

I made this website as an experiment with GPT4 to see if it could help someone with no experience using React and Threejs build an entire 3D site from the ground-up.
The design is a little obnoxious and overstimulating, but I wanted to play around with Threejs and other frontend tools and have fun with what I could create using GPT4.

Feel free to use it as a template for your own portfolio, include credits if you want to but don't feel obligated, you're welcome to just delete the footer.
Because I used GPT for a large portion of this and did not know what I was doing at first, the code is quite messy and includes some unnecessary bits.
I'll attempt to do a cleanup to make it easier to understand and edit following exams likely, feel free to reach out if you're having trouble deciphering some of it.
